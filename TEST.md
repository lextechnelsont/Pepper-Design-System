## Component Naming Guidelines

To keep the design system organized and discoverable, each component name includes the prefix `LT` followed by a version stamp.

- **Prefix**: `LT` identifies components that belong to Lextech.
- **Date**: Use `YYYY-MMDD` to mark the creation date. For example, a component created on May 14, 2025 receives `2025-0514`.
- **Multiple Versions**: If more than one version is created on the same day, append a lowercase letter in alphabetical order, such as `2025-0514a`, `2025-0514b`, and so on.

Example: `LTButton-2025-0514a` denotes the first revision of the button component created on May 14, 2025.

These naming conventions help prevent conflicts, clarify version history, and communicate ownership at a glance.
